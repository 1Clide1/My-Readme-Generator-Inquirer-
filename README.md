## Installation
  
to install this project just clone my repo, open your favourite ide after cloning, make sure to open index.js in your intergrated terminal, make sure you have node js (at least version 14 and up), once open in your terminal type npm install to get inquirer, then finally type node index.js to run the program!
  
## Usage
  
The usage of this app is to soley create readmes that look professional and are easy to use giving you everything you need to get a good foundation to build on if you want to. This makes it easier to focus on the project/app and have a peace of mind that everytime you need to create a readme you have a great template to work on.
  
## Credits
  
This project was tricky to structure and make because I wasn't sure how in depth I wanted this readme to be. I knew I at least wanted the basics and I feel like I have achieved that. I will probably add upon this in the future but as of right now I think this readme is good enough to get the ball rolling. I feel like I don't specifically have a person to shoutout but the website stack overflow was a lot of help making me understand how certain ideas like regex works and I feel like if used right you can pretty much find a solution to your problem that you can use/tweak to fit what you need it to be. I also want to say Inquirer has a really good documentation on how to use the app. This project was fun making something that I will personally use for my upcoming projects and for whoever sees this hopefully it can give you some use too. At the top of this readme I will include a link to show a demo of how this program works that way you can see it's not to complicated to use.
